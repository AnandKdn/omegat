What is OmegaT?
---------------

OmegaT is a free and open source multiplatform Computer Assisted Translation tool with fuzzy matching, translation memory, keyword search, glossaries, and translation leveraging into updated projects.


Prerequisites
-------------

OmegaT requires the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 1.8 or higher to be installed on your system.

We recommand to use OmegaT packages which include JRE, to save you the trouble of selecting, obtaining and installing it.


Installing OmegaT (Windows)
---------------------------

Launch the installation program.


Installing OmegaT (Mac)
-----------------------

Copy the OmegaT.zip archive to a suitable location and unpack it there to obtain a folder that contains an HTML documentation index file and OmegaT.app, the application file.


Installing OmegaT (Linux)
-------------------------

Place the archive in any suitable folder and unpack it. OmegaT is then ready to be launched.

You can however obtain a neater and more user-friendly installation by using the installation script (linux-install.sh). To use this script, open a terminal window (console), change folder to the folder containing OmegaT.jar and the linux-install.sh script, and execute the script with ./linux-install.sh.


Installing OmegaT (Solaris, FreeBSD, ...)
-----------------------------------------

"
To install OmegaT, create a suitable folder for OmegaT. Copy the OmegaT zip or tar.bz2 archive to this folder and unpack it there.
"
[ Question: what difference comparing with Linux? ]


Using Java Web Start for installing OmegaT (all plateforms)
-----------------------------------------------------------

If you have already Java installed on your system, one way to install OmegaT is to use Java Web Start.

For this purpose download the following file and then execute it:

   http://omegat.sourceforge.net/webstart/OmegaT.jnlp

It will install the correct environment for your computer and the application itself on the first run. Later calls do not need to be online.


Launching OmegaT (Windows)
--------------------------

If, during installation, you have created a shortcut on the desktop, double-click on that shortcut.

The install program can create shortcuts for you in the start menu, on the desktop and in the quick launch area. You can also manually drag the file OmegaT.exe to the start menu, the desktop or the quick launch area
to link it from there.

If you can see the file OmegaT but not OmegaT.exe in your File Manager (Windows Explorer), change the settings so that file extensions are displayed.


Launching OmegaT (Mac)
----------------------

Double-click on the file OmegaT.app.

You may drag OmegaT.app to your dock or to the tool bar of a Finder window to be able to launch it from any location. You can also call it in the Spotlight search field.


Launching OmegaT (Linux)
------------------------

If you used linux-install.sh script, you should be able to launch OmegaT with:

  Alt+F2

and then:

  omegat

For a more user-friendly way of launching OmegaT, you can use the Kaptain script provided (omegat.kaptn). To use this script you must first install Kaptain. You can then launch the Kaptain launch script with:

  Alt+F2

and then:

  omegat.kaptn


Launching OmegaT from the command line (all systems)
----------------------------------------------------

The command to launch OmegaT is:

cd <folder where the file OmegaT.jar is located>

<name and path of the Java executable file> -jar OmegaT.jar

(The Java executable file is the file java on Linux and java.exe on Windows.
If Java is installed at system level and is in the command path, the full path need not be entered.)
